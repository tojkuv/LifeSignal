## Overview

This document provides detailed specifications for the LifeSignal security model. The LifeSignal application uses Firebase Security Rules for access control and data validation.

## Security Principles

The LifeSignal security model follows these principles:

1. **Least Privilege**: Users have the minimum access necessary to perform their functions
2. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
3. **Zero Trust**: All requests are authenticated and authorized, regardless of source
4. **Data Validation**: All data is validated before being stored
5. **Audit Logging**: All security-relevant events are logged

## Firebase Security Rules

### User Data Rules

```javascript
// Users collection rules
match /users/{userId} {
  // User can read and write their own data
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  
  // Contacts subcollection rules
  match /contacts/{contactId} {
    // User can read and write their own contacts
    allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
  }
}
```

### Contact Relationship Rules

The security model enforces bidirectional contact relationships:

1. **Contact Creation**: Both users must consent to the relationship
2. **Contact Deletion**: Either user can delete the relationship
3. **Role Updates**: Both users must agree to role changes

### Function Security

Cloud Functions enforce additional security checks:

1. **Authentication**: All functions require authentication
2. **Authorization**: Functions verify that the user has permission to perform the operation
3. **Input Validation**: Functions validate all input parameters
4. **Rate Limiting**: Functions implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Data Protection

### Personal Data

The LifeSignal application handles personal data with care:

1. **Minimal Collection**: Only collecting necessary personal information
2. **Secure Storage**: Encrypting personal data at rest
3. **Secure Transmission**: Encrypting personal data in transit
4. **Access Control**: Restricting access to personal data

### Phone Numbers

Phone numbers are handled with special care:

1. **E.164 Format**: Storing phone numbers in E.164 format for consistency
2. **Authentication**: Using phone numbers for authentication
3. **Contact Matching**: Using phone numbers for contact matching
4. **Display Format**: Formatting phone numbers for display based on user locale

## Security Testing

The LifeSignal security model is tested through:

1. **Unit Tests**: Testing individual security rules
2. **Integration Tests**: Testing security rules in combination
3. **Penetration Testing**: Attempting to bypass security controls
4. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Scanning for known vulnerabilities

## Incident Response

The LifeSignal security model includes incident response procedures:

1. **Detection**: Monitoring for security incidents
2. **Containment**: Limiting the impact of security incidents
3. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of security incidents
4. **Recovery**: Restoring normal operations
5. **Lessons Learned**: Improving security based on incidents

## Compliance

The LifeSignal application is designed to comply with:

1. **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
2. **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
3. **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (where applicable)
4. **PIPEDA**: Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (Canada)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Rule Implementation

1. **Rule Testing**: Test security rules before deployment
2. **Rule Documentation**: Document the purpose of each security rule
3. **Rule Versioning**: Version security rules alongside application code
4. **Rule Monitoring**: Monitor security rule performance and effectiveness

### Function Security Implementation

1. **Authentication Verification**: Verify authentication in all functions
2. **Authorization Checks**: Implement explicit authorization checks
3. **Input Sanitization**: Sanitize all input to prevent injection attacks
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling without leaking sensitive information

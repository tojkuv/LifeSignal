# LifeSignal iOS Implementation Examples

**Navigation:** [Back to Application Specification](../README.md) | [Implementation Examples](ImplementationExamples.md)

---

## Overview

This directory contains example implementations of various components of the LifeSignal iOS application using The Composable Architecture (TCA). These examples serve as reference implementations and best practices for developers working on the application.

## Example Types

### [Implementation Examples](ImplementationExamples.md)

A comprehensive set of implementation examples, including:

#### Feature Implementation
- State definition
- Action definition
- Reducer implementation
- Effect handling
- Dependency usage

#### View Implementation
- Store binding
- View composition
- Navigation and presentation
- UI components

#### Client Interface Implementation
- Interface definition
- Live implementation
- Test implementation
- Preview implementation
- Dependency registration

#### Adapter Implementation
- Adapter definition
- Backend integration
- Error handling
- Data transfer objects

#### Testing Implementation
- Unit tests for reducers
- Dependency overrides
- Test store usage
- Assertion patterns

## Usage Guidelines

These examples should be used as reference implementations when developing new features or components for the LifeSignal iOS application. They demonstrate the recommended patterns and practices for using TCA in the context of the LifeSignal application.

When implementing a new feature or component, start by reviewing the relevant example and adapt it to your specific needs. This will ensure consistency across the codebase and adherence to the established architectural patterns.

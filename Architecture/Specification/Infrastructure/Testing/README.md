---

## Overview

This document outlines the testing strategy for the LifeSignal iOS application. It covers the different types of tests, testing tools, test organization, and best practices for writing effective tests.

## Testing Principles

The LifeSignal iOS application follows these testing principles:

1. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** - Write tests before implementing features to ensure code is testable and meets requirements.
2. **Comprehensive Test Coverage** - Aim for high test coverage across all layers of the application.
3. **Fast and Reliable Tests** - Tests should be fast and reliable to encourage frequent testing.
4. **Isolated Tests** - Tests should be isolated from each other and from external dependencies.
5. **Realistic Test Data** - Use realistic test data to ensure tests are meaningful.
6. **Continuous Integration** - Run tests automatically on every commit to catch issues early.

## Test Types

The LifeSignal iOS application uses the following types of tests:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components in isolation.
2. **Integration Tests** - Test interactions between components.
3. **UI Tests** - Test the user interface and user flows.
4. **Performance Tests** - Test the performance of critical operations.

### Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation, such as reducers, effects, and utilities. They use mock dependencies to isolate the component being tested from its dependencies.

Example unit test for a reducer:

```swift
@MainActor
final class CheckInFeatureTests: XCTestCase {
    func testCheckIn() async {
        let store = TestStore(initialState: CheckInFeature.State()) {
            CheckInFeature()
        } withDependencies: {
            $0.checkInClient = .mock(
                checkIn: {
                    return Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
                }
            )
        }
        
        await store.send(.checkInButtonTapped) {
            $0.isCheckingIn = true
        }
        
        await store.receive(.checkInResponse(.success(Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)))) {
            $0.isCheckingIn = false
            $0.lastCheckInTime = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
            $0.nextCheckInTime = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 86400) // 24 hours later
        }
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests focus on testing interactions between components, such as features and their dependencies. They use real or realistic mock implementations of dependencies to test the integration between components.

Example integration test for a feature and its client:

```swift
@MainActor
final class CheckInFeatureIntegrationTests: XCTestCase {
    func testCheckInWithRealClient() async {
        let store = TestStore(initialState: CheckInFeature.State()) {
            CheckInFeature()
        } withDependencies: {
            $0.checkInClient = .liveValue
            $0.userClient = .liveValue
        }
        
        // Test the feature with real clients
        // Note: This requires a real backend or a realistic mock
    }
}
```

### UI Tests

UI tests focus on testing the user interface and user flows. They use XCUITest to interact with the application's UI and verify that it behaves correctly.

Example UI test for the check-in flow:

```swift
final class CheckInUITests: XCTestCase {
    let app = XCUIApplication()
    
    override func setUp() {
        super.setUp()
        continueAfterFailure = false
        app.launch()
        
        // Sign in and navigate to the check-in screen
        // ...
    }
    
    func testCheckInButton() {
        let checkInButton = app.buttons["Check In Now"]
        XCTAssertTrue(checkInButton.exists)
        
        checkInButton.tap()
        
        // Verify that the check-in was successful
        let successMessage = app.staticTexts["Check-in successful"]
        XCTAssertTrue(successMessage.waitForExistence(timeout: 5))
    }
}
```

### Performance Tests

Performance tests focus on testing the performance of critical operations. They use XCTest's performance measurement APIs to measure the time taken by operations and ensure they meet performance requirements.

Example performance test for loading check-in history:

```swift
@MainActor
final class CheckInPerformanceTests: XCTestCase {
    func testLoadCheckInHistoryPerformance() {
        let checkInClient = CheckInClient.liveValue
        
        measure {
            Task {
                _ = try await checkInClient.getCheckInHistory()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Tools

The LifeSignal iOS application uses the following testing tools:

1. **XCTest** - Apple's testing framework for Swift and Objective-C.
2. **XCUITest** - Apple's UI testing framework for iOS applications.
3. **TestStore** - TCA's testing utility for testing reducers and effects.
4. **Dependencies** - TCA's dependency injection system for providing mock dependencies.
5. **ViewInspector** - A library for testing SwiftUI views.

### XCTest

XCTest is Apple's testing framework for Swift and Objective-C. It provides the foundation for all tests in the LifeSignal iOS application.

### XCUITest

XCUITest is Apple's UI testing framework for iOS applications. It allows tests to interact with the application's UI and verify that it behaves correctly.

### TestStore

TestStore is TCA's testing utility for testing reducers and effects. It allows tests to send actions to a store and verify that the state changes and effects are executed correctly.

Example usage:

```swift
let store = TestStore(initialState: CheckInFeature.State()) {
    CheckInFeature()
} withDependencies: {
    $0.checkInClient = .mock(
        checkIn: {
            return Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
        }
    )
}

await store.send(.checkInButtonTapped) {
    $0.isCheckingIn = true
}

await store.receive(.checkInResponse(.success(Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)))) {
    $0.isCheckingIn = false
    $0.lastCheckInTime = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
    $0.nextCheckInTime = Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 86400) // 24 hours later
}
```

### Dependencies

Dependencies is TCA's dependency injection system. It allows tests to provide mock implementations of dependencies to isolate the component being tested from its dependencies.

Example usage:

```swift
withDependencies {
    $0.checkInClient = .mock(
        checkIn: {
            return Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0)
        }
    )
    $0.date = .constant(Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0))
    $0.uuid = .constant(UUID(uuidString: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000")!)
} operation: {
    // Test code that uses these dependencies
}
```

### ViewInspector

ViewInspector is a library for testing SwiftUI views. It allows tests to inspect the structure of SwiftUI views and interact with them programmatically.

Example usage:

```swift
let view = CheckInView(
    store: Store(initialState: CheckInFeature.State()) {
        CheckInFeature()
    }
)

let checkInButton = try view.inspect().find(button: "Check In Now")
try checkInButton.tap()

// Verify that the view updated correctly
```

## Test Organization

Tests in the LifeSignal iOS application are organized according to the following principles:

1. **Mirror the Application Structure** - Test files mirror the structure of the application code.
2. **One Test File per Component** - Each component has a corresponding test file.
3. **Group Tests by Type** - Tests are grouped by type (unit, integration, UI, performance).
4. **Descriptive Test Names** - Test names clearly describe what is being tested.

### Directory Structure

The test directory structure mirrors the application directory structure:

```

│   └── AppFeatureTests.swift
├── Features/
│   ├── Auth/
│   │   └── AuthFeatureTests.swift

    │   └── ...
    └── Components/
        ├── ButtonTests.swift
        ├── CardTests.swift
        └── ...
```

### Test Naming

Test names follow a consistent pattern:

- **Test Class Names**: `{ComponentName}Tests`
- **Test Method Names**: `test{Behavior}_{Condition}_{ExpectedResult}`

Example:

```swift
final class CheckInFeatureTests: XCTestCase {
    func testCheckIn_WhenSuccessful_UpdatesState() async {
        // Test code...
    }
    
    func testCheckIn_WhenFails_SetsError() async {
        // Test code...
    }
}
```

## Mock Implementations

The LifeSignal iOS application uses mock implementations of dependencies for testing. Mocks are implemented using the following patterns:

1. **Interface-Based Mocks** - Mocks implement the same interface as the real implementation.
2. **Configurable Behavior** - Mocks allow tests to configure their behavior.
3. **Verification** - Mocks allow tests to verify that they were called correctly.

### Mock Clients

Mock clients implement the client interfaces and allow tests to configure their behavior:

```swift
extension CheckInClient {
    static func mock(
        checkIn: @escaping () async throws -> Date = { Date() },
        getCheckInHistory: @escaping () async throws -> [CheckInRecord] = { [] },
        getCheckInInterval: @escaping () async throws -> TimeInterval = { 86400 },
        setCheckInInterval: @escaping (TimeInterval) async throws -> Void = { _ in },
        getReminderInterval: @escaping () async throws -> TimeInterval = { 7200 },
        setReminderInterval: @escaping (TimeInterval) async throws -> Void = { _ in }
    ) -> Self {
        Self(
            checkIn: checkIn,
            getCheckInHistory: getCheckInHistory,
            getCheckInInterval: getCheckInInterval,
            setCheckInInterval: setCheckInInterval,
            getReminderInterval: getReminderInterval,
            setReminderInterval: setReminderInterval
        )
    }
}
```

### Mock Dependencies

Mock dependencies are registered with the dependency injection system:

```swift
extension DependencyValues {
    var checkInClient: CheckInClient {
        get { self[CheckInClient.self] }
        set { self[CheckInClient.self] = newValue }
    }
}

extension CheckInClient: DependencyKey {
    static var testValue: Self {
        return Self(
            checkIn: unimplemented("CheckInClient.checkIn"),
            getCheckInHistory: unimplemented("CheckInClient.getCheckInHistory"),
            getCheckInInterval: unimplemented("CheckInClient.getCheckInInterval"),
            setCheckInInterval: unimplemented("CheckInClient.setCheckInInterval"),
            getReminderInterval: unimplemented("CheckInClient.getReminderInterval"),
            setReminderInterval: unimplemented("CheckInClient.setReminderInterval")
        )
    }
}
```

### Mock Data

Mock data is used for testing:

```swift
extension User {
    static let mock = User(
        id: "user123",
        firstName: "John",
        lastName: "Doe",
        phoneNumber: "+1234567890",
        profilePictureURL: nil,
        emergencyNote: nil,
        lastCheckInTime: Date(timeIntervalSince1970: 0),
        checkInInterval: 86400,
        reminderInterval: 7200
    )
}
```

## Test Coverage

The LifeSignal iOS application aims for high test coverage across all layers of the application. Test coverage is measured using Xcode's code coverage tools and is monitored as part of the continuous integration process.

### Coverage Targets

The application has the following test coverage targets:

- **Features**: 90% or higher
- **Domain Models**: 90% or higher
- **Clients**: 90% or higher
- **Adapters**: 80% or higher
- **Utilities**: 80% or higher
- **Views**: 70% or higher

### Coverage Reporting

Test coverage is reported as part of the continuous integration process. Coverage reports are generated for each build and are available for review.

## Continuous Integration

Tests are run automatically on every commit using a continuous integration (CI) system. The CI system runs all tests and reports any failures or coverage issues.

### CI Workflow

The CI workflow includes the following steps:

1. **Build** - Build the application and test targets.
2. **Unit Tests** - Run unit tests.
3. **Integration Tests** - Run integration tests.
4. **UI Tests** - Run UI tests.
5. **Performance Tests** - Run performance tests.
6. **Coverage** - Generate and report test coverage.

### CI Notifications

The CI system sends notifications when tests fail or when coverage drops below the target thresholds. Notifications are sent to the development team to ensure that issues are addressed promptly.

## Best Practices

When writing tests for the LifeSignal iOS application, follow these best practices:

1. **Write Tests First** - Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) by writing tests before implementing features.

2. **Test One Thing at a Time** - Each test should focus on testing one specific behavior or condition.

3. **Use Descriptive Test Names** - Test names should clearly describe what is being tested.

4. **Use Realistic Test Data** - Use realistic test data to ensure tests are meaningful.

5. **Isolate Tests** - Tests should be isolated from each other and from external dependencies.

6. **Test Edge Cases** - Test edge cases and error conditions, not just the happy path.

7. **Keep Tests Fast** - Tests should be fast to encourage frequent testing.

8. **Keep Tests Simple** - Tests should be simple and easy to understand.

9. **Test Public API** - Focus on testing the public API of components, not implementation details.

10. **Refactor Tests** - Refactor tests to keep them clean and maintainable.

## Conclusion

The testing strategy outlined in this document provides a comprehensive approach to testing the LifeSignal iOS application. By following this strategy, the development team can ensure that the application is reliable, maintainable, and meets the needs of its users.

## Overview

The RespondersFeature is responsible for managing the user's responder contacts in the LifeSignal iOS application. It allows users to view their responders, respond to pings, and manage responder relationships. The feature is designed to help users maintain their safety network of responders who can assist them in emergency situations.

## Responsibilities

- Display the list of responder contacts
- Show responder status (available, busy, non-responsive)
- Allow users to respond to pings from responders
- Allow users to respond to all pings at once
- Enable adding new responders via QR code scanning
- Manage responder relationship details
- Show pending ping count and notifications

## User Experience

The RespondersFeature provides the following user experience:

1. **Responder List** - Displays the user's responders with their name, photo, and status
2. **Ping Response** - Allows users to respond to pings from responders
3. **Respond to All** - Allows users to respond to all pending pings at once
4. **Add Responder** - Enables adding new responders via QR code scanning
5. **Responder Details** - Shows detailed information about a responder and allows managing the relationship

## Dependencies

The RespondersFeature depends on the following clients:

- **ContactClient** - For contact relationship operations
- **PingClient** - For ping operations
- **UserClient** - For user profile operations

## Feature Composition

The RespondersFeature is composed of the following child features:

- **ContactDetailsSheetViewFeature** - For viewing and managing responder details
- **QRScannerFeature** - For scanning QR codes to add new responders
- **AddContactFeature** - For adding new responders

## Integration with Other Features

The RespondersFeature integrates with the following features:

- **ContactsFeature** - The RespondersFeature is a child of the ContactsFeature
- **PingFeature** - The RespondersFeature uses the PingFeature for ping operations

## Implementation Details

The RespondersFeature is implemented using The Composable Architecture (TCA) with the following components:

- **State** - Defines the feature's state
- **Action** - Defines the actions that can be performed on the feature
- **Reducer** - Defines how the state changes in response to actions
- **View** - Displays the feature's UI and handles user interaction

For detailed implementation information, see:

- [State](State.md) - Detailed information about the feature's state
- [Actions](Actions.md) - Detailed information about the feature's actions
- [Effects](Effects.md) - Detailed information about the feature's effects

## Example Implementation

For a complete example implementation of a TCA feature, see the [FeatureExample](../../Examples/FeatureExample.md) document.

## Testing

The RespondersFeature is tested using the following approach:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test the reducer logic in isolation
   - Test each action and its effect on the state
   - Test success and failure paths
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

2. **Integration Tests** - Test the feature's integration with its dependencies
   - Test contact operations with mock dependencies
   - Test ping operations with mock dependencies
   - Test error handling with simulated failures

3. **UI Tests** - Test the feature's UI and user interactions
   - Test responder list display
   - Test ping response
   - Test adding new responders
   - Test responder details

## Overview

The QRCodeFeature is responsible for managing QR code functionality in the LifeSignal iOS application. It allows users to generate and share QR codes for adding contacts, and it enables scanning QR codes to add new contacts. The feature is designed to simplify the process of establishing contact relationships between users.

## Responsibilities

- Generate QR codes for the user to share
- Display QR codes with proper styling and information
- Allow refreshing/regenerating QR codes
- Enable scanning QR codes to add new contacts
- Process scanned QR code data
- Provide a sharing interface for QR codes

## User Experience

The QRCodeFeature provides the following user experience:

1. **QR Code Generation** - Generates a QR code containing the user's contact information
2. **QR Code Display** - Displays the QR code with proper styling and information
3. **QR Code Refresh** - Allows the user to refresh/regenerate the QR code
4. **QR Code Sharing** - Enables sharing the QR code via standard sharing options
5. **QR Code Scanning** - Allows scanning QR codes to add new contacts
6. **QR Code Processing** - Processes scanned QR code data to extract contact information

## Dependencies

The QRCodeFeature depends on the following clients:

- **QRCodeClient** - For QR code operations
- **UserClient** - For user profile operations

## Feature Composition

The QRCodeFeature is composed of the following child features:

- **QRCodeShareFeature** - For generating and sharing QR codes
- **QRScannerFeature** - For scanning QR codes

## Integration with Other Features

The QRCodeFeature integrates with the following features:

- **ProfileFeature** - The QRCodeFeature is used in the profile screen to display the user's QR code
- **RespondersFeature** - The QRCodeFeature is used to scan QR codes to add new responders
- **DependentsFeature** - The QRCodeFeature is used to scan QR codes to add new dependents

## Implementation Details

The QRCodeFeature is implemented using The Composable Architecture (TCA) with the following components:

- **State** - Defines the feature's state
- **Action** - Defines the actions that can be performed on the feature
- **Reducer** - Defines how the state changes in response to actions
- **View** - Displays the feature's UI and handles user interaction

For detailed implementation information, see:

- [State](State.md) - Detailed information about the feature's state
- [Actions](Actions.md) - Detailed information about the feature's actions
- [Effects](Effects.md) - Detailed information about the feature's effects

## Example Implementation

For a complete example implementation of a TCA feature, see the [FeatureExample](../../Examples/FeatureExample.md) document.

## Testing

The QRCodeFeature is tested using the following approach:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test the reducer logic in isolation
   - Test each action and its effect on the state
   - Test success and failure paths
   - Test edge cases and error conditions

2. **Integration Tests** - Test the feature's integration with its dependencies
   - Test QR code generation with mock dependencies
   - Test QR code scanning with mock dependencies
   - Test error handling with simulated failures

3. **UI Tests** - Test the feature's UI and user interactions
   - Test QR code display
   - Test QR code refresh
   - Test QR code sharing
   - Test QR code scanning

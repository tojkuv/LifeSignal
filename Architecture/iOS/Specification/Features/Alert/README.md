## Overview

The AlertFeature is responsible for managing the user's alert functionality. It allows users to trigger alerts, view their alert status, and manage their alert settings. The feature is designed to help users quickly notify their responders in emergency situations.

## Responsibilities

- Allow users to trigger alerts manually
- Display the user's current alert status (active or inactive)
- Allow users to cancel active alerts
- Manage alert notifications to responders
- Track alert history
- Provide a multi-step activation process to prevent accidental alerts

## User Experience

The AlertFeature provides the following user experience:

1. **Alert Button** - A prominent button that allows users to trigger alerts manually
2. **Activation Process** - A multi-step process to prevent accidental alerts:
   - Initial tap fills 25% of the button width
   - Each subsequent tap fills an additional 25%
   - When completely filled, the alert is activated
3. **Deactivation Process** - A 3-second hold with animation expanding from center to edges
4. **Status Display** - Shows the user's current alert status (active or inactive)
5. **Alert History** - Shows the user's alert history

## Dependencies

The AlertFeature depends on the following clients:

- **AlertClient** - For alert operations
- **UserClient** - For user profile operations
- **NotificationClient** - For notification operations
- **ContactClient** - For accessing responder information

## Feature Composition

The AlertFeature is a standalone feature without child features.

## Integration with Other Features

The AlertFeature integrates with the following features:

- **HomeFeature** - The AlertFeature is displayed on the home screen
- **NotificationFeature** - Alert notifications are displayed in the notification center
- **RespondersFeature** - Responders are notified when an alert is triggered

## Implementation Details

The AlertFeature is implemented using The Composable Architecture (TCA) with the following components:

- **State** - Defines the feature's state
- **Action** - Defines the actions that can be performed on the feature
- **Reducer** - Defines how the state changes in response to actions
- **View** - Displays the feature's UI and handles user interaction

For detailed implementation information, see:

- [State](State.md) - Detailed information about the feature's state
- [Actions](Actions.md) - Detailed information about the feature's actions
- [Effects](Effects.md) - Detailed information about the feature's effects

## Example Implementation

For a complete example implementation of the AlertFeature, see the [FeatureExample](../../Examples/FeatureExample.md) document.

## Testing

The AlertFeature is tested using the following approach:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test the reducer and effects in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test the feature's integration with its dependencies
3. **UI Tests** - Test the feature's UI and user interaction

Example test cases include:

- Test alert activation
- Test alert deactivation
- Test alert notification
- Test alert history tracking
- Test multi-step activation process

## Acceptance Criteria

The AlertFeature must meet the following acceptance criteria:

1. Users must be able to trigger alerts manually
2. The alert status must be clearly displayed
3. Users must be able to cancel active alerts
4. Responders must be notified when a user triggers an alert
5. The feature must work offline and sync when the device is online
6. The feature must handle error conditions gracefully
7. The multi-step activation process must prevent accidental alerts
8. The deactivation process must require a deliberate action

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the AlertFeature include:

1. **Automatic Alerts** - Allow users to set up automatic alerts based on location or activity
2. **Custom Alert Messages** - Allow users to set custom messages for different types of alerts
3. **Alert Categories** - Allow users to categorize alerts by severity or type
4. **Alert Analytics** - Provide analytics on alert patterns and history
5. **Geolocation** - Include the user's location when an alert is triggered

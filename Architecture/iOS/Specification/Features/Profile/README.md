## Implementation Details

The ProfileFeature is implemented using The Composable Architecture (TCA) with the following components:

- **State** - Defines the feature's state
- **Action** - Defines the actions that can be performed on the feature
- **Reducer** - Defines how the state changes in response to actions
- **View** - Displays the feature's UI and handles user interaction

For detailed implementation information, see:

- [State](State.md) - Detailed information about the feature's state
- [Actions](Actions.md) - Detailed information about the feature's actions
- [Effects](Effects.md) - Detailed information about the feature's effects

## Example Implementation

For a complete example implementation of a TCA feature, see the [FeatureExample](../../Examples/FeatureExample.md) document.

## Testing

The ProfileFeature is tested using the following approach:

1. **Unit Tests** - Test the reducer logic in isolation
2. **Integration Tests** - Test the feature's integration with its dependencies
3. **UI Tests** - Test the feature's UI and user interactions

Example test cases include:

- Test that the profile information is displayed correctly
- Test that the profile information can be edited
- Test that the emergency note can be updated
- Test that the profile picture can be updated

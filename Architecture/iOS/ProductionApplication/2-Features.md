# Features

TCA Reducer Features implement comprehensive state management and side effects using State, Action, Reducer, and Store patterns for each feature in the iOS production application.

## Content Structure

### Modern Feature Components
- **@ObservableState**: Use `@ObservableState` macro for automatic SwiftUI observation and Sendable conformance
- **@CasePathable Actions**: Define actions with `@CasePathable` for case key path access and type-safe action handling
- **@Reducer Macro**: Use `@Reducer` macro for automatic Store generation and scope integration
- **Async/Await Effects**: Implement effects with `Effect.run` using async/await and proper Task cancellation
- **Dependency Injection**: Integrate with @Dependency system for clean separation and testable architecture
- **Strict Concurrency**: Follow Swift's strict concurrency model with Sendable types and actor isolation

### Modern State Management
- **@ObservableState Macro**: Automatic Sendable conformance and SwiftUI observation without manual implementation
- **Immutable State Trees**: Compose state hierarchically with clear feature boundaries and isolated mutations
- **Direct Store Observation**: Views directly observe Store without ViewStore wrapper for simplified integration
- **Shared State Integration**: Use @Shared for cross-feature state sharing with proper isolation and testing support
- **Concurrency Safety**: All state types automatically conform to Sendable through @ObservableState macro
- **Type-Safe Updates**: Leverage Swift's value semantics for predictable and atomic state mutations

### Modern Effect Management
- **Async/Await Effects**: Use `Effect.run` with async/await for clean asynchronous operation handling
- **Cancellation Context**: Implement proper Task cancellation with cancellation IDs and context propagation
- **@Dependency Integration**: Inject platform and domain clients through @Dependency for clean architecture
- **Error Transformation**: Transform errors into semantic actions maintaining unidirectional data flow
- **Effect Lifecycle**: Manage complete effect lifecycles with proper resource cleanup and cancellation
- **Concurrent Effect Management**: Handle multiple concurrent effects with proper isolation and cancellation

## Error Handling

### Modern Error Categories
- **Async Effect Errors**: Effect failures with proper async/await error propagation and cancellation context handling
- **Dependency Client Errors**: Two-tier client failures with graceful degradation through test/preview dependency variants
- **Concurrency Errors**: Swift strict concurrency violations, actor isolation issues, and Sendable conformance failures
- **State Consistency Errors**: Invalid state transitions with atomic updates and conflict resolution strategies
- **Navigation State Errors**: Stack and tree navigation inconsistencies with automatic recovery mechanisms
- **Action Processing Errors**: Malformed actions, missing reducer cases, and dispatch failures with type-safe handling

### Modern Recovery Strategies
- **Semantic Error Actions**: Transform errors into typed actions with associated values maintaining type safety and data flow
- **Dependency Fallback Systems**: Use @Dependency test/preview variants for automatic graceful degradation during failures
- **Task Cancellation Recovery**: Implement proper async Task cancellation with cleanup and resource management
- **State-Driven Error UI**: Reflect error states through reducer updates for automatic UI error display and recovery options
- **Effect Retry Patterns**: Implement exponential backoff retry mechanisms with proper cancellation and context management
- **Shared State Error Handling**: Handle errors in @Shared state with proper isolation and conflict resolution
- **Context Propagation**: Maintain error context through async effect chains for comprehensive debugging and recovery
- **Client Layer Error Mapping**: Map platform client errors to domain errors with appropriate user messaging and recovery actions

## Testing

### Effect Testing

- **Concurrency Testing**: Validate Sendable conformance and thread safety in effect implementations

### Integration Testing
- **Feature Composition Testing**: Integration testing of parent-child feature relationships and communication patterns
- **Dependency Testing**: Mock dependency validation ensuring proper injection and isolation during testing
- **State Synchronization Testing**: Testing complex state interactions and data flow between features
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete feature workflows with realistic data and user interactions

### Development Testing
- **Mock Dependencies**: Controlled dependency implementations for deterministic testing scenarios and isolation
- **Performance Testing**: Feature performance analysis and optimization tools for development debugging and validation
- **Memory Testing**: Testing proper memory management and effect lifecycle handling
- **Dependency Injection Testing**: Test-friendly dependency substitution enabling comprehensive feature testing
- **@Dependency Testing**: Test dependency injection patterns with proper mock implementations
- **Task Lifecycle Testing**: Test proper Task creation, execution, and cancellation in feature effects

## Anti-patterns

### Architecture Violations
- **Monolithic Features**: Creating features that handle multiple concerns violating single responsibility principle and reducing composability
- **Business Logic in Views**: Implementing complex business logic directly in SwiftUI views instead of delegating to reducers
- **Side Effects in Reducers**: Implementing side effects directly in reducers instead of using Effects for asynchronous operations
- **Tight Coupling**: Creating tightly coupled features that depend on internal implementation details of other features

### Effect Management Issues
- **Missing Cancellation**: Not canceling long-running effects when features are dismissed leading to memory leaks and unexpected behavior
- **Expensive Reducer Operations**: Performing expensive operations directly in reducers blocking the main thread and degrading UI performance
- **High-frequency Actions**: Sending high-frequency actions directly to reducers without debouncing or throttling mechanisms
- **Synchronous Effects**: Implementing synchronous operations that should be asynchronous within effects
- **Poor Task Management**: Not properly managing Task lifecycle in effects leading to resource leaks
- **Missing Sendable**: Not conforming state types to Sendable for concurrency safety
- **Outdated Async Patterns**: Using completion handlers instead of modern async/await in effects

### Testing Deficiencies
- **Exhaustive Testing**: Creating exhaustive tests that verify everything in one go leading to fragile and unmaintainable test suites
- **Missing Dependency Injection**: Not implementing proper dependency injection reducing testability and increasing coupling between components
- **Poor Test Coverage**: Not testing all state transitions, error conditions, and edge cases in features
- **Integration Gaps**: Not testing feature composition and parent-child relationships comprehensively

### Design Problems
- **Breaking Encapsulation**: Observing internal child feature actions in parent reducers without clear boundaries breaking encapsulation
- **Excessive Binding**: Using @Binding excessively for complex data flow instead of leveraging TCA's unidirectional architecture
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Not following TCA's architectural patterns leading to unpredictable behavior and maintenance issues
- **Poor Action Design**: Using actions as methods for sharing logic instead of representing events that occurred

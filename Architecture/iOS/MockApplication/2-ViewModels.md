# ViewModels

ViewModels provide simple presentation state management for the iOS Mock Application, focusing on UI state transitions, user interaction handling, and view data preparation. They serve as lightweight coordinators between the view layer and mock data, emphasizing demonstration of user interface patterns rather than complex business logic.

## Content Structure

### Presentation State Management
- **UI State Focus**: Manage presentation state including loading indicators, form validation, and user interaction feedback
- **Screen Coordination**: Coordinate state between related UI components within a single screen or feature area
- **Mock Data Integration**: Bridge between view layer and hard-coded mock data to demonstrate realistic user experiences
- **Simple Reactivity**: Use `ObservableObject` and `@Published` properties for straightforward view updates

### User Interaction Handling
- **Action Coordination**: Handle user actions like button taps, form submissions, and navigation triggers
- **State Transitions**: Manage transitions between different UI states such as loading, success, error, and empty states
- **Input Validation**: Provide immediate feedback for user input validation and form completion guidance
- **Navigation Logic**: Coordinate navigation events and screen transitions based on user interactions

### Mock Data Strategy
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Provide diverse mock data scenarios to demonstrate various UI states and edge cases
- **Content Variety**: Include different content lengths, types, and edge cases to stress-test UI layouts
- **User Journey Simulation**: Structure mock data to support complete user journey demonstrations
- **Dynamic Content**: Simulate real-world content variations including empty states, error conditions, and success scenarios

### View Integration
- **Presentation Logic**: Handle view-specific logic such as formatting, sorting, and filtering for display purposes
- **Computed Properties**: Provide computed properties that transform raw data into view-friendly formats
- **State Broadcasting**: Communicate state changes to multiple view components through observable patterns
- **Lifecycle Management**: Manage ViewModel lifecycle in coordination with view appearance and disappearance

## Testing

### Presentation Logic Testing
- **State Transition Testing**: Validate UI state transitions triggered by user interactions and system events
- **Mock Data Validation**: Ensure mock data accurately represents real-world scenarios and edge cases
- **View Binding Testing**: Test that ViewModels properly communicate state changes to connected views
- **User Interaction Testing**: Validate ViewModel responses to simulated user actions and input events

### User Experience Testing
- **Interaction Flow Testing**: Test complete user interaction flows through ViewModels to validate user experience
- **Content Scenario Testing**: Validate ViewModel behavior with different content scenarios including edge cases
- **Error State Testing**: Test error handling and recovery scenarios to ensure graceful user experience
- **Performance Testing**: Validate ViewModel performance with various content loads and interaction patterns

### Prototype Validation
- **Design Intent Testing**: Validate that ViewModels support intended user experience and design patterns
- **Content Strategy Testing**: Test ViewModels with realistic content variations to inform design decisions
- **User Flow Testing**: Validate complete user flows through ViewModel state management
- **Accessibility Testing**: Ensure ViewModels provide appropriate state information for accessibility features

### Mock Data Testing
- **Scenario Coverage**: Test ViewModels with comprehensive mock data scenarios representing real-world usage
- **Edge Case Validation**: Validate ViewModel behavior with edge cases including empty states and error conditions
- **Content Diversity Testing**: Test ViewModels with diverse content types, lengths, and cultural variations
- **Dynamic Content Testing**: Validate ViewModel behavior with changing content and real-time updates

## Anti-patterns

### Presentation Anti-patterns
- **Over-complicated State**: Creating unnecessarily complex state management for simple presentation needs
- **Business Logic Inclusion**: Including actual business logic in mock ViewModels instead of focusing on UI demonstration
- **Unrealistic Mock Data**: Using mock data that doesn't represent realistic user scenarios or content variations
- **Poor State Communication**: Failing to properly communicate state changes to views resulting in inconsistent UI updates

### User Experience Anti-patterns
- **Inconsistent Interaction Feedback**: Providing inconsistent or unclear feedback for user interactions across different screens
- **Poor Content Strategy**: Failing to consider content strategy and information architecture in ViewModel design
- **Accessibility Oversight**: Not providing appropriate state information for accessibility features and assistive technologies
- **Navigation Confusion**: Creating confusing navigation patterns or state transitions that disrupt user mental models

### Design Process Anti-patterns
- **Assumption-Based Implementation**: Creating ViewModels based on assumptions rather than validated user experience requirements
- **Isolation from Design**: Developing ViewModels without proper collaboration with design and user experience teams
- **Static Content Thinking**: Designing ViewModels that don't account for dynamic content, localization, or accessibility needs
- **Feedback Resistance**: Ignoring user testing results or stakeholder feedback in ViewModel design and implementation

### Implementation Anti-patterns
- **Platform Convention Violations**: Implementing patterns that violate iOS platform conventions and user expectations
- **Performance Neglect**: Creating ViewModels that cause poor UI performance through inefficient state management
- **Maintenance Ignorance**: Implementing ViewModels that are difficult to understand, modify, or extend for design iterations
- **Context Blindness**: Failing to consider the broader context of user goals and application ecosystem in ViewModel design

# LifeSignal Architecture

**Navigation:** [iOS Architecture](iOS/README.md) | [Backend Architecture](Backend/README.md)

> **Note:** This architecture documentation is being refactored to improve organization, reduce duplication, and ensure consistency. The current structure reflects the new organization that will be refined based on real-world usage and feedback.

## Overview

LifeSignal is a comprehensive safety and wellness application built with a multi-platform approach:

- **iOS Application** - Built with Swift using The Composable Architecture (TCA)
- **Backend** - Built with Firebase (Cloud Functions, Firestore, Authentication)
- **Android Application** - Planned future implementation

This architecture documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the design, implementation, and best practices for all components of the LifeSignal application.

## Core Architecture Principles

Across all platforms and components, LifeSignal follows these core principles:

1. **Modular Features** - Organize code by feature rather than by technical layer
2. **Middleware Clients** - Build features that are independent of specific backend technologies through backend agnostic anti-corruption clients
3. **Type Safety** - Maintain strong typing throughout the codebase
4. **Concurrency Safety** - Handle asynchronous operations safely and efficiently
5. **Testability** - Design all components to be testable in isolation
6. **Separation of Concerns** - Maintain clear boundaries between different layers of the application
7. **Security First** - Implement robust security practices throughout the application

## Platform-Specific Architecture

### iOS Application

The iOS application uses The Composable Architecture (TCA) with a layered approach:

```
Feature Layer → Middleware Clients → Adapters → Platform Backend Clients → Backend
(UserFeature)    (UserClient)       (FirebaseUserAdapter)  (FirebaseClient)     (Firebase/Supabase)
```

Key components:
- **State Management** - Using TCA's state, action, reducer pattern
- **Effect Management** - Using TCA's effect system for side effects
- **Dependency Injection** - Using TCA's dependency system
- **Navigation** - Using TCA's navigation patterns

### Backend

The backend is built using Firebase Cloud Functions with TypeScript:

```
Cloud Functions → Firestore → Security Rules → Authentication
(Business Logic)   (Data Storage) (Access Control)  (User Management)
```

Key components:
- **Cloud Functions** - Server-side business logic
- **Firestore** - NoSQL database for data storage
- **Security Rules** - Declarative access control
- **Authentication** - User authentication and session management

### Android Application (Future)

The Android application will follow similar architectural principles as the iOS application, adapted for the Android platform:

- **State Management** - Using a unidirectional data flow pattern
- **Dependency Injection** - Using a DI framework
- **Concurrency** - Using Kotlin coroutines
- **UI** - Using Jetpack Compose

## Cross-Platform Integration

The LifeSignal application integrates across platforms through:

1. **Shared Domain Model** - Consistent data models across all platforms
2. **Firebase Backend** - Central backend services for all client applications
3. **Consistent Security Model** - Uniform security practices across platforms
4. **Feature Parity** - Ensuring all platforms provide the same core functionality

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Planning** - Define features and requirements
2. **Architecture Design** - Design the feature architecture
3. **Implementation** - Implement the feature across platforms
4. **Testing** - Test the feature thoroughly
5. **Deployment** - Deploy the feature to production

## Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation is organized into platform-specific sections:

1. **[iOS Architecture](iOS/README.md)**: Documentation for the iOS application
   - [Guidelines](iOS/Guidelines/README.md): How to implement
   - [Specification](iOS/Specification/README.md): What to implement

2. **[Backend Architecture](Backend/README.md)**: Documentation for the backend services
   - [Guidelines](Backend/Guidelines/README.md): How to implement
   - [Specification](Backend/Specification/README.md): What to implement

## Implementation Strategy

The LifeSignal implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Mock Application**: MVVM-based mock application for UI/UX iteration
2. **Production Application**: TCA-based production application
3. **Backend Services**: Firebase and Supabase services
4. **Android Application**: Future implementation

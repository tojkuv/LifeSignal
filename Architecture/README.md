# LifeSignal Architecture

**Navigation:** [General Architecture](General/README.md) | [iOS Architecture](iOS/README.md) | [Backend Architecture](Backend/README.md)

> **Note:** This architecture is still an MVP and the folder structure and files are likely to change as the project evolves. The current implementation is a starting point that will be refined based on real-world usage and feedback.

## Overview

LifeSignal is a comprehensive safety and wellness application built with a multi-platform approach:

- **iOS Application** - Built with Swift using The Composable Architecture (TCA)
- **Backend** - Built with Firebase (Cloud Functions, Firestore, Authentication)
- **Android Application** - Planned future implementation

This architecture documentation provides a comprehensive guide to the design, implementation, and best practices for all components of the LifeSignal application.

## Core Architecture Principles

Across all platforms and components, LifeSignal follows these core principles:

1. **Vertical Slice Architecture** - Organize code by feature rather than by technical layer
2. **Infrastructure Agnosticism** - Build features that are independent of specific backend technologies
3. **Type Safety** - Maintain strong typing throughout the codebase
4. **Concurrency Safety** - Handle asynchronous operations safely and efficiently
5. **Testability** - Design all components to be testable in isolation
6. **Separation of Concerns** - Maintain clear boundaries between different layers of the application
7. **Security First** - Implement robust security practices throughout the application

## Platform-Specific Architecture

### iOS Application

The iOS application uses The Composable Architecture (TCA) with a layered approach:

```
Feature Layer → Domain-Specific Clients → Core Infrastructure Clients → Adapters → Backend
(UserFeature)    (UserClient)            (StorageClient)              (StorageAdapter)  (Firebase)
```

Key components:
- **State Management** - Using TCA's state, action, reducer pattern
- **Effect Management** - Using TCA's effect system for side effects
- **Dependency Injection** - Using TCA's dependency system
- **Navigation** - Using TCA's navigation patterns

### Backend

The backend is built using Firebase Cloud Functions with TypeScript:

```
Cloud Functions → Firestore → Security Rules → Authentication
(Business Logic)   (Data Storage) (Access Control)  (User Management)
```

Key components:
- **Cloud Functions** - Server-side business logic
- **Firestore** - NoSQL database for data storage
- **Security Rules** - Declarative access control
- **Authentication** - User authentication and session management

### Android Application (Future)

The Android application will follow similar architectural principles as the iOS application, adapted for the Android platform:

- **State Management** - Using a unidirectional data flow pattern
- **Dependency Injection** - Using a DI framework
- **Concurrency** - Using Kotlin coroutines
- **UI** - Using Jetpack Compose

## Cross-Platform Integration

The LifeSignal application integrates across platforms through:

1. **Shared Domain Model** - Consistent data models across all platforms
2. **Firebase Backend** - Central backend services for all client applications
3. **Consistent Security Model** - Uniform security practices across platforms
4. **Feature Parity** - Ensuring all platforms provide the same core functionality

## Development Workflow

1. **Feature Planning** - Define features and requirements
2. **Architecture Design** - Design the feature architecture
3. **Implementation** - Implement the feature across platforms
4. **Testing** - Test the feature thoroughly
5. **Deployment** - Deploy the feature to production

## Documentation Structure

The architecture documentation is organized as follows:

- **[General Architecture](General/README.md)** - Platform-agnostic architectural principles
  - Core Principles, Vertical Slice Architecture, Infrastructure Agnosticism, etc.

- **[iOS Architecture](iOS/README.md)** - iOS-specific architecture documentation
  - TCA Implementation, Firebase Integration, Feature Architecture, Navigation, Testing, etc.

- **[Backend Architecture](Backend/README.md)** - Backend-specific architecture documentation
  - Core Principles, Function Architecture, Data Model, Security Rules, etc.

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a solid foundation for building a scalable, maintainable, and testable multi-platform application. By following consistent architectural principles across platforms, we ensure that the LifeSignal application is flexible and can adapt to changing requirements.

> **Important:** This architecture document represents the current MVP state of the project. The folder structure, file organization, and specific implementation details are expected to evolve as the project matures. We will continuously refine this architecture based on real-world usage patterns and feedback.

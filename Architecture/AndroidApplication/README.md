# LifeSignal Android Architecture (Future)

**Navigation:** [Back to Main Architecture](../README.md) | [iOS Architecture](../iOSApplication/README.md) | [Backend Architecture](../Backend/README.md)

---

> **Note:** This is a placeholder for the future Android architecture documentation.

## Overview

The Android application will follow similar architectural principles as the iOS application, adapted for the Android platform:

- **State Management** - Using a unidirectional data flow pattern
- **Dependency Injection** - Using a DI framework
- **Concurrency** - Using Kotlin coroutines
- **UI** - Using Jetpack Compose

## Planned Architecture

The Android architecture will be based on:

1. **Clean Architecture** - Separation of concerns with domain, data, and presentation layers
2. **MVVM Pattern** - Model-View-ViewModel pattern for UI components
3. **Unidirectional Data Flow** - Similar to TCA's state, action, reducer pattern
4. **Dependency Injection** - Using Hilt or Koin
5. **Kotlin Coroutines** - For asynchronous operations
6. **Jetpack Compose** - For declarative UI
7. **Firebase Integration** - Similar to iOS, with infrastructure-agnostic clients

## Planned Documentation

When implemented, this directory will contain detailed documentation about different aspects of the LifeSignal Android architecture:

- Core Principles
- Infrastructure Layers
- Client Architecture
- Feature Architecture
- State Management
- Navigation
- Testing Strategy
- Performance Considerations
- Security Considerations

## Conclusion

The Android architecture will be designed to be consistent with the iOS architecture, ensuring that the same architectural principles are applied across platforms. This will enable code sharing at the conceptual level and ensure that the Android application provides the same functionality as the iOS application.

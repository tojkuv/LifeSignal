# Features

TCA Reducer Features implement comprehensive state management and side effects using State, Action, Reducer, and Store patterns for each feature in the iOS production application.

## Content Structure

### Feature Components
- **State**: Immutable `struct` state with `@ObservableState` for automatic UI updates
- **Action**: Define events via `Action` enums representing what happened
- **Reducer**: Handle side effects with `Effect.run` and IDs for cancellation
- **Store**: Each feature includes State, Action, Reducer, and Store
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Swift's type system for compile-time safety and error prevention
- **Sendable Conformance**: Ensure all state types conform to Sendable for concurrency safety

### State Management
- **Immutable State**: Use immutable `struct` state with `@ObservableState`
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized state management for each feature
- **State Composition**: Compose features hierarchically with clear boundaries
- **Direct State Access**: Modern TCA enables direct state observation
- **Concurrency Safety**: Follow Swift's strict concurrency requirements for state access
- **Value Semantics**: Leverage Swift's value types for predictable state mutations

### Side Effects
- **Effect.run**: Handle side effects with `Effect.run` and async/await
- **Cancellation IDs**: Use IDs for effect cancellation and resource cleanup
- **Dependency Injection**: Integrate with dependency system for testable effects using @Dependency
- **Error Handling**: Transform errors into actions for proper state management
- **Task Management**: Proper Task lifecycle management with cancellation support
- **Async/Await Integration**: Use modern Swift concurrency patterns throughout effects

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Effect Errors**: Asynchronous operation failures transformed into actions for proper state management and user feedback
- **Validation Errors**: User input validation failures and business rule violations with contextual messaging
- **Network Errors**: API failures, connectivity issues, timeout errors, and service unavailability with retry mechanisms
- **State Errors**: Invalid state transitions, concurrent modification conflicts, and consistency violations
- **Dependency Errors**: External service failures and integration issues with graceful degradation patterns
- **System Errors**: Platform-specific errors, permission denials, and device capability failures

### Recovery Strategies
- **Action-Based Error Flow**: Errors transformed into actions within Effects maintaining unidirectional data flow
- **State-Driven Error Display**: Error state reflected in UI through reducer state updates and view rendering
- **Result Type Integration**: Structured error handling through Result types and action-based error communication
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic and user-initiated retry patterns for transient failures with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback functionality and limited feature sets during error conditions
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messaging with actionable recovery steps and contextual information
- **Async Error Handling**: Use async/await with proper error propagation and Task cancellation
- **Effect Cancellation**: Implement proper effect cancellation for error recovery and resource cleanup

## Testing

### Reducer Testing
- **TestStore Framework**: Built-in TCA testing framework for exhaustive reducer and effect validation
- **State Transition Testing**: Comprehensive validation of state changes and action handling patterns
- **Business Logic Testing**: Isolated testing of business logic using TestStore with predictable scenarios

### Effect Testing
- **Asynchronous Operation Testing**: Testing effects with mock dependencies and controlled execution environments
- **Cancellation Testing**: Testing proper effect cancellation and resource cleanup
- **TestClock Integration**: Predictable time-based testing for effects involving timers and scheduling
- **Error Handling Testing**: Testing error propagation and recovery strategies within effects
- **Async/Await Testing**: Test async effects with proper Task management and cancellation handling
- **Concurrency Testing**: Validate Sendable conformance and thread safety in effect implementations

### Integration Testing
- **Feature Composition Testing**: Integration testing of parent-child feature relationships and communication patterns
- **Dependency Testing**: Mock dependency validation ensuring proper injection and isolation during testing
- **State Synchronization Testing**: Testing complex state interactions and data flow between features
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete feature workflows with realistic data and user interactions

### Development Testing
- **Mock Dependencies**: Controlled dependency implementations for deterministic testing scenarios and isolation
- **Performance Testing**: Feature performance analysis and optimization tools for development debugging and validation
- **Memory Testing**: Testing proper memory management and effect lifecycle handling
- **Dependency Injection Testing**: Test-friendly dependency substitution enabling comprehensive feature testing
- **@Dependency Testing**: Test dependency injection patterns with proper mock implementations
- **Task Lifecycle Testing**: Test proper Task creation, execution, and cancellation in feature effects

## Anti-patterns

### Architecture Violations
- **Monolithic Features**: Creating features that handle multiple concerns violating single responsibility principle and reducing composability
- **Business Logic in Views**: Implementing complex business logic directly in SwiftUI views instead of delegating to reducers
- **Side Effects in Reducers**: Implementing side effects directly in reducers instead of using Effects for asynchronous operations
- **Tight Coupling**: Creating tightly coupled features that depend on internal implementation details of other features

### Effect Management Issues
- **Missing Cancellation**: Not canceling long-running effects when features are dismissed leading to memory leaks and unexpected behavior
- **Expensive Reducer Operations**: Performing expensive operations directly in reducers blocking the main thread and degrading UI performance
- **High-frequency Actions**: Sending high-frequency actions directly to reducers without debouncing or throttling mechanisms
- **Synchronous Effects**: Implementing synchronous operations that should be asynchronous within effects
- **Poor Task Management**: Not properly managing Task lifecycle in effects leading to resource leaks
- **Missing Sendable**: Not conforming state types to Sendable for concurrency safety
- **Outdated Async Patterns**: Using completion handlers instead of modern async/await in effects

### Testing Deficiencies
- **Exhaustive Testing**: Creating exhaustive tests that verify everything in one go leading to fragile and unmaintainable test suites
- **Missing Dependency Injection**: Not implementing proper dependency injection reducing testability and increasing coupling between components
- **Poor Test Coverage**: Not testing all state transitions, error conditions, and edge cases in features
- **Integration Gaps**: Not testing feature composition and parent-child relationships comprehensively

### Design Problems
- **Breaking Encapsulation**: Observing internal child feature actions in parent reducers without clear boundaries breaking encapsulation
- **Excessive Binding**: Using @Binding excessively for complex data flow instead of leveraging TCA's unidirectional architecture
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Not following TCA's architectural patterns leading to unpredictable behavior and maintenance issues
- **Poor Action Design**: Using actions as methods for sharing logic instead of representing events that occurred

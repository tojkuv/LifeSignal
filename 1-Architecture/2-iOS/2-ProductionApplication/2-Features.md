# Features

Features in the iOS Production Application serve as TCA Reducer-based business logic components that encapsulate state management, action handling, and side effects. They provide modular, composable, and testable architecture patterns with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive dependency management for robust production-grade applications.

## Content Structure

### Feature Architecture
- **State Management**: Immutable value types using @ObservableState structs for automatic SwiftUI observation and efficient change detection
- **Action Definition**: Comprehensive event modeling through enum-based action systems representing "what happened" rather than intended effects
- **Reducer Composition**: Pure function-based business logic implementation through Reducer protocol conformance with deterministic state transformations
- **Effect Management**: Comprehensive side effect handling through TCA's Effect system and asynchronous operation management

### State Management
- **@ObservableState Structs**: Value-type state containers with automatic SwiftUI observation and efficient change detection
- **Single Source of Truth**: Centralized state management eliminating data inconsistencies and synchronization issues
- **Hierarchical Composition**: Nested state structures for complex features with clear data organization and boundaries
- **State Mutations**: Direct state modification within reducer functions ensuring predictable behavior and performance

### Action Handling
- **Event-Based Design**: Actions represent "what happened" rather than intended effects for clear separation of concerns
- **Exhaustive Handling**: Enum-based actions ensuring all possible events are explicitly handled by reducers
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time validation of action handling with associated values and payload validation
- **Action Boundaries**: Clear action scope definition preventing unintended cross-feature dependencies and coupling

### Effect Management
- **Effect.run Integration**: Swift Concurrency support with async/await patterns for modern asynchronous programming
- **Cancellation Management**: Effect cancellation with unique identifiers for resource cleanup and lifecycle management
- **Dependency Integration**: Seamless integration with dependency injection for testable and modular side effects
- **Effect Testing**: Comprehensive testing support through TestStore and controlled execution environments

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Effect Errors**: Asynchronous operation failures transformed into actions for proper state management and user feedback
- **Validation Errors**: User input validation failures and business rule violations with contextual messaging
- **Network Errors**: API failures, connectivity issues, timeout errors, and service unavailability with retry mechanisms
- **State Errors**: Invalid state transitions, concurrent modification conflicts, and consistency violations
- **Dependency Errors**: External service failures and integration issues with graceful degradation patterns
- **System Errors**: Platform-specific errors, permission denials, and device capability failures

### Recovery Strategies
- **Action-Based Error Flow**: Errors transformed into actions within Effects maintaining unidirectional data flow
- **State-Driven Error Display**: Error state reflected in UI through reducer state updates and view rendering
- **Result Type Integration**: Structured error handling through Result types and action-based error communication
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic and user-initiated retry patterns for transient failures with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback functionality and limited feature sets during error conditions
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messaging with actionable recovery steps and contextual information

## Testing

### Reducer Testing
- **TestStore Framework**: Built-in TCA testing framework for exhaustive reducer and effect validation
- **State Transition Testing**: Comprehensive validation of state changes and action handling patterns
- **Business Logic Testing**: Isolated testing of business logic using TestStore with predictable scenarios
- **Pure Function Testing**: Testing reducer functions in isolation with deterministic inputs and outputs

### Effect Testing
- **Asynchronous Operation Testing**: Testing effects with mock dependencies and controlled execution environments
- **Cancellation Testing**: Testing proper effect cancellation and resource cleanup
- **TestClock Integration**: Predictable time-based testing for effects involving timers and scheduling
- **Error Handling Testing**: Testing error propagation and recovery strategies within effects

### Integration Testing
- **Feature Composition Testing**: Integration testing of parent-child feature relationships and communication patterns
- **Dependency Testing**: Mock dependency validation ensuring proper injection and isolation during testing
- **State Synchronization Testing**: Testing complex state interactions and data flow between features
- **End-to-End Testing**: Testing complete feature workflows with realistic data and user interactions

### Development Testing
- **Mock Dependencies**: Controlled dependency implementations for deterministic testing scenarios and isolation
- **Performance Testing**: Feature performance analysis and optimization tools for development debugging and validation
- **Memory Testing**: Testing proper memory management and effect lifecycle handling
- **Dependency Injection Testing**: Test-friendly dependency substitution enabling comprehensive feature testing

## Anti-patterns

### Architecture Violations
- **Monolithic Features**: Creating features that handle multiple concerns violating single responsibility principle and reducing composability
- **Business Logic in Views**: Implementing complex business logic directly in SwiftUI views instead of delegating to reducers
- **Side Effects in Reducers**: Implementing side effects directly in reducers instead of using Effects for asynchronous operations
- **Tight Coupling**: Creating tightly coupled features that depend on internal implementation details of other features

### Effect Management Issues
- **Missing Cancellation**: Not canceling long-running effects when features are dismissed leading to memory leaks and unexpected behavior
- **Expensive Reducer Operations**: Performing expensive operations directly in reducers blocking the main thread and degrading UI performance
- **High-frequency Actions**: Sending high-frequency actions directly to reducers without debouncing or throttling mechanisms
- **Synchronous Effects**: Implementing synchronous operations that should be asynchronous within effects

### Testing Deficiencies
- **Exhaustive Testing**: Creating exhaustive tests that verify everything in one go leading to fragile and unmaintainable test suites
- **Missing Dependency Injection**: Not implementing proper dependency injection reducing testability and increasing coupling between components
- **Poor Test Coverage**: Not testing all state transitions, error conditions, and edge cases in features
- **Integration Gaps**: Not testing feature composition and parent-child relationships comprehensively

### Design Problems
- **Breaking Encapsulation**: Observing internal child feature actions in parent reducers without clear boundaries breaking encapsulation
- **Excessive Binding**: Using @Binding excessively for complex data flow instead of leveraging TCA's unidirectional architecture
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Not following TCA's architectural patterns leading to unpredictable behavior and maintenance issues
- **Poor Action Design**: Using actions as methods for sharing logic instead of representing events that occurred

# Clients

Clients in the iOS Production Application serve as dependency-injected service abstractions that provide domain-specific business logic and platform integration capabilities. They enable testable, modular, and maintainable architecture patterns with clear separation of concerns and comprehensive error handling for robust production-grade applications using TCA's @DependencyClient from swift-dependencies.

## Content Structure

### Client Architecture
- **Dependency Management**: Centralized dependency registration through DependencyValues and @Dependency property wrapper
- **Service Abstraction**: Protocol-based interfaces defining clear contracts for external service interactions
- **Implementation Separation**: Clear separation between live production implementations and test mock implementations
- **Injection Mechanism**: Automatic dependency injection through TCA's dependency management system

### Domain Clients
- **Business Logic Encapsulation**: Domain clients provide high-level business operations combining multiple lower-level services
- **Service Composition**: Domain clients compose multiple platform clients to provide cohesive business functionality
- **Multi-Service Operations**: Coordinated operations across multiple platform services with transaction-like behavior
- **Business Rule Enforcement**: Domain-specific validation and business logic implementation within client abstractions

### Platform Integration
- **System Framework Clients**: Protocol-based abstractions for iOS system frameworks and device capabilities
- **Network Clients**: URLSession abstraction for HTTP requests with authentication, retry logic, and error handling
- **Storage Clients**: Core Data, UserDefaults, and file system abstractions with consistent interfaces
- **Device Capability Clients**: Location services, camera, contacts, and sensor access with permission management

### Service Abstraction
- **Interface Contracts**: Well-defined method signatures with explicit input/output types and error handling
- **Behavioral Specifications**: Clear documentation of expected behavior, side effects, and error conditions
- **Dependency Relationships**: Explicit dependency declarations enabling proper injection and testing
- **Lifecycle Management**: Proper resource management and cleanup for long-running services and connections

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Network Errors**: API failures, connectivity issues, timeout errors, and service unavailability with retry mechanisms
- **Authentication Errors**: Token expiration, permission denials, and authentication failures with re-authentication flows
- **Validation Errors**: Input validation failures, business rule violations, and data format issues with contextual messaging
- **Service Errors**: External service failures, rate limiting, and integration issues with graceful degradation
- **Platform Errors**: iOS system framework errors, device capability failures, and permission denials
- **Dependency Errors**: Client initialization failures, configuration errors, and service unavailability

### Recovery Strategies
- **Effect-Based Error Flow**: Errors captured in Effects and transformed into actions maintaining unidirectional data flow
- **Result Type Integration**: Structured error handling through Result types and action-based error communication
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic and user-initiated retry patterns for transient failures with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback functionality and limited feature sets during error conditions
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messaging with actionable recovery steps and contextual information
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and analytics for debugging and system improvement

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- **TestStore Framework**: Built-in TCA testing framework for exhaustive client and dependency validation
- **Mock Dependencies**: Controlled dependency implementations for deterministic testing scenarios and isolation
- **Dependency Testing**: Comprehensive validation of dependency injection patterns and service substitution mechanisms
- **Contract Testing**: Interface contract validation ensuring compatibility between client abstractions and implementations

### Integration Testing
- **End-to-End Testing**: Client behavior testing with realistic service interactions and error scenarios
- **Service Integration Testing**: Testing client behavior with actual external services in controlled environments
- **Multi-Client Testing**: Testing complex workflows that involve multiple client interactions
- **Performance Testing**: Client performance analysis and optimization for production workloads and scalability

### Error Handling Testing
- **Error Simulation**: Comprehensive error condition simulation for robust error handling testing
- **Recovery Testing**: Testing error recovery mechanisms and graceful degradation patterns
- **Retry Logic Testing**: Testing automatic and user-initiated retry patterns with various failure scenarios
- **Timeout Testing**: Testing client behavior under various timeout and connectivity conditions

### Development Testing
- **Dependency Injection Testing**: Test-friendly dependency substitution enabling comprehensive client testing and validation
- **Performance Profiling**: Client performance analysis and optimization tools for development debugging and validation
- **Memory Testing**: Testing proper memory management and resource cleanup in client implementations
- **Concurrency Testing**: Testing client behavior under concurrent access and Swift's strict concurrency requirements

## Anti-patterns

### Dependency Management Issues
- **Global Singletons**: Using global singletons or hardcoded dependencies instead of dependency injection reducing testability and modularity
- **Missing Test Implementations**: Omitting test implementations leading to flaky, slow, and non-deterministic tests with external dependencies
- **Circular Dependencies**: Creating circular dependencies between clients causing initialization issues and architectural complexity
- **Poor Injection Patterns**: Not following TCA's dependency management patterns leading to unpredictable behavior and maintenance issues

### Architecture Violations
- **Business Logic in Clients**: Implementing complex business logic directly in client implementations instead of delegating to domain services
- **Business Logic in Effects**: Putting business logic in Effects instead of reducers violating TCA's architectural principles
- **Tight Coupling**: Creating tightly coupled client implementations that depend on internal details of other clients
- **Complex Protocol Hierarchies**: Using overly complex protocol hierarchies for simple clients when struct-based interfaces would be more ergonomic

### Error Handling Deficiencies
- **Poor Error Handling**: Not implementing proper error handling leading to poor user experience and difficult debugging
- **Missing Error Recovery**: Not implementing comprehensive error recovery strategies for robust user experience
- **Inadequate Error Testing**: Not testing all error conditions and recovery mechanisms comprehensively
- **Poor Error Communication**: Not providing clear error messaging and actionable recovery steps to users

### Testing and Performance Issues
- **Insufficient Testing**: Not implementing comprehensive testing for client behavior and dependency injection patterns
- **Performance Ignorance**: Ignoring performance considerations for client operations leading to poor user experience
- **Concurrency Issues**: Not following Swift and iOS development best practices for concurrency safety and resource management
- **Memory Leaks**: Not implementing proper resource management and cleanup for long-running services and connections

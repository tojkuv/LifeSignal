# Views

TCA-compliant SwiftUI Views integrate with The Composable Architecture using Store patterns and ViewStore management while maintaining UI/UX parity with the mock application.

## Content Structure

### UI/UX Parity
- **Same Components**: Same component hierarchy and styling as the mock application
- **Design System**: Use identical design tokens and visual styling
- **User Experience**: Maintain identical user flows and interactions
- **Only Data Flow Changes**: Only data flow and side effects change from mock version

### TCA Integration
- **Store Integration**: Views observe TCA Store for state and dispatch actions
- **@ObservableState**: Use `@ObservableState` for automatic UI updates with modern TCA patterns
- **Action Dispatching**: Send user interactions as typed actions to Store
- **Unidirectional Flow**: Maintain unidirectional data flow pattern
- **Store Scoping**: Use Store scoping for child features and modular architecture
- **Type Safety**: Leverage Swift's type system for compile-time safety in TCA integration

### View Architecture
- **UI Focused**: Views focus on UI presentation and user interaction
- **No Business Logic**: Keep business logic in reducers, not in views
- **State Observation**: Observe state changes and render UI accordingly
- **Action Sending**: Send actions for user interactions and lifecycle events
- **Sendable Conformance**: Ensure all state types conform to Sendable for concurrency safety
- **SwiftUI Best Practices**: Follow SwiftUI's declarative patterns and modern view composition

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Network Errors**: API failures, connectivity issues, timeout errors, and service unavailability with retry mechanisms
- **Validation Errors**: User input validation failures, form errors, and data format issues with clear feedback
- **State Errors**: Invalid state transitions, concurrent modification conflicts, and consistency violations
- **System Errors**: Device capability failures, permission denials, and platform-specific errors with graceful degradation
- **Business Logic Errors**: Domain-specific validation failures and business rule violations with contextual messaging
- **Effect Errors**: Asynchronous operation failures, dependency errors, and external service integration issues

### Recovery Strategies
- **Effect-Based Error Handling**: Errors transformed into actions within Effects for proper state management and user feedback
- **State-Driven Error Display**: Error state reflected in UI through reducer state updates and view rendering
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic and user-initiated retry patterns for transient failures with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Fallback functionality and limited feature sets during error conditions
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messaging with actionable recovery steps and contextual information
- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive error tracking and analytics for debugging and system improvement
- **Async Error Handling**: Use async/await with proper error propagation and Task cancellation in effects
- **Effect Cancellation**: Implement proper effect cancellation for error recovery and resource cleanup

## Testing

### Reducer Testing
- **TestStore Framework**: Built-in TCA testing framework for exhaustive reducer and effect validation
- **State Transition Testing**: Comprehensive validation of state changes and action handling patterns
- **Effect Testing**: Asynchronous operation testing with mock dependencies and controlled environments
- **Business Logic Testing**: Isolated testing of business logic using TestStore with predictable scenarios
- **Async Effect Testing**: Test async/await effects with proper Task management and cancellation handling
- **Concurrency Testing**: Validate Sendable conformance and thread safety in reducer implementations

### View Integration Testing
- **SwiftUI Testing**: Native SwiftUI testing capabilities with ViewInspector integration for view validation
- **Store Integration Testing**: Testing SwiftUI view integration with TCA Store and user interaction simulation
- **Action Dispatching Testing**: Validation that user interactions correctly trigger appropriate actions
- **State Rendering Testing**: Testing that view correctly renders different state configurations
- **Store Scoping Testing**: Test Store scoping for child features and modular architecture
- **Type Safety Testing**: Validate Swift's type system usage in TCA integration

### Visual Testing
- **Snapshot Testing**: Visual regression testing for consistent UI appearance across devices and configurations
- **Accessibility Testing**: Comprehensive validation of VoiceOver support, Dynamic Type, and assistive technology compatibility
- **Xcode Previews**: Real-time view rendering with multiple Store states and configuration validation
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Testing view behavior across different device sizes and orientations
- **@ObservableState Testing**: Test automatic UI updates with modern TCA state observation patterns
- **SwiftUI Composition Testing**: Test modern view composition and declarative patterns

### Development Testing
- **Mock Dependencies**: Controlled dependency implementations for deterministic testing scenarios
- **Performance Testing**: View rendering performance analysis and TCA integration optimization tools
- **Memory Testing**: Testing proper memory management and Store lifecycle handling
- **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing of complete feature flows with realistic data and interactions
- **Dependency Testing**: Test @Dependency integration and mock implementations in TCA features
- **Effect Cancellation Testing**: Test proper effect cancellation and resource cleanup

## Anti-patterns

### Architecture Violations
- **Business Logic in Views**: Implementing complex business logic directly in SwiftUI views instead of delegating to reducers
- **State Mutation**: Mutating state outside of reducers bypassing unidirectional data flow and predictable state management
- **Action Misuse**: Using actions as methods for sharing logic instead of representing events that occurred
- **Side Effects in Reducers**: Implementing side effects directly in reducers instead of using Effects for asynchronous operations
- **Missing Sendable**: Not conforming state types to Sendable for concurrency safety
- **Poor Store Scoping**: Not using Store scoping for child features creating tight coupling

### Performance Issues
- **Over-observing State**: Over-observing state in views leading to unnecessary re-renders and performance degradation
- **High-frequency Actions**: Sending high-frequency actions directly to reducers without debouncing or throttling mechanisms
- **Synchronous Action Chains**: Creating synchronous action chains that immediately trigger other actions leading to complex debugging
- **Memory Leaks**: Not properly managing Store lifecycle and subscriptions leading to memory issues
- **Poor Task Management**: Not properly managing Task lifecycle in effects leading to resource leaks
- **Missing Effect Cancellation**: Not canceling long-running effects when features are dismissed

### Testing Deficiencies
- **Missing Testing**: Not implementing comprehensive testing for reducers and effects missing TCA's testability advantages
- **Poor Dependency Management**: Ignoring TCA's dependency management system for external services reducing testability and modularity
- **Insufficient Coverage**: Not testing all state transitions, error conditions, and edge cases in features
- **Integration Gaps**: Not testing view-store integration and user interaction flows comprehensively
- **Missing Async Testing**: Not properly testing async/await effects and Task lifecycle
- **Poor Concurrency Testing**: Not testing Sendable conformance and thread safety

### Design Problems
- **Monolithic Features**: Creating monolithic features that violate single responsibility principle and reduce composability
- **Poor Store Scoping**: Not using Store scoping for child features creating tight coupling and state management complexity
- **Architectural Inconsistency**: Not following TCA's architectural patterns leading to unpredictable behavior and maintenance issues
- **Complex View Logic**: Creating complex view logic that should be handled in reducers or effects
- **Missing Type Safety**: Not leveraging Swift's type system for compile-time safety in TCA integration
- **Outdated Async Patterns**: Using completion handlers instead of modern async/await in effects

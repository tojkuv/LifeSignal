# Views

Views in the iOS Mock Application provide SwiftUI-based user interface components using vanilla MVVM architecture. They focus on delivering reusable design system components with comprehensive accessibility support and seamless integration with ViewModels for rapid prototyping and development validation without extensive state management.

## Content Structure

### View Architecture
- **MVVM Pattern**: Views serve as lightweight presentation layers that observe ViewModels and render UI declaratively
- **Property Wrappers**: Use @State for local view state, @Binding for parent-child communication, and @ObservedObject for ViewModel integration
- **Declarative Syntax**: Leverage SwiftUI's declarative approach for clear, maintainable view code
- **Single Responsibility**: Each view component has a focused purpose with clear boundaries

### Design System Components
- **Typography System**: Standardized text styles using SwiftUI's semantic font system for accessibility and platform consistency
- **Color Palette**: Semantic color system leveraging iOS system colors for accessibility and dark mode support
- **Reusable Components**: Modular UI components that can be composed together for consistent visual language
- **Accessibility Support**: Built-in VoiceOver labels, Dynamic Type support, and inclusive design patterns

### Data Binding
- **Reactive Updates**: Automatic UI updates through @Published properties and Combine framework integration
- **Type Safety**: Strong type system with property wrappers for compile-time validation and error prevention
- **State Management**: Simple state management appropriate for mock applications without complex business logic
- **ViewModel Integration**: Seamless data binding through SwiftUI property wrappers

### Navigation and Layout
- **Responsive Design**: Layouts that adapt to different screen sizes, orientations, and accessibility requirements
- **Navigation Patterns**: Standard iOS navigation patterns using NavigationView and sheet presentations
- **Modular Composition**: Views composed of smaller, reusable components for maintainability
- **Performance Optimization**: Efficient view rendering with minimal state management overhead

## Testing

### Unit Testing
- **View Components**: Isolated testing of view components with mock ViewModels and predictable data states
- **Property Wrapper Testing**: Validation of @State, @Binding, and @ObservedObject behavior in different scenarios
- **Data Binding Verification**: Testing that view updates correctly reflect ViewModel state changes
- **Component Isolation**: Testing individual view components in isolation from their dependencies

### UI Testing
- **User Interaction Testing**: End-to-end testing of user interactions using XCUITest framework
- **Navigation Flow Testing**: Validation of navigation patterns and view transitions
- **Accessibility Testing**: Comprehensive validation of VoiceOver support and assistive technology compatibility
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Testing view behavior across different device sizes and orientations

### Visual Testing
- **Xcode Previews**: Real-time view rendering with multiple device configurations and accessibility settings
- **Snapshot Testing**: Visual regression testing for consistent UI appearance across devices and configurations
- **Design System Validation**: Testing that components follow design system guidelines and visual consistency
- **Preview Providers**: Comprehensive preview providers for different states and configurations

### Development Testing
- **Mock ViewModels**: Deterministic test data providers for consistent preview states and development scenarios
- **Accessibility Inspector**: Built-in accessibility validation tools for VoiceOver testing and compliance verification
- **Performance Profiling**: View hierarchy analysis and rendering performance optimization
- **Live Preview Testing**: Interactive testing during development using Xcode's live preview functionality

## Anti-patterns

### Architecture Violations
- **Business Logic in Views**: Implementing business logic directly in SwiftUI views instead of delegating to ViewModels
- **Complex State Management**: Using complex state management patterns inappropriate for mock applications
- **Tight Coupling**: Creating tightly coupled view components that reduce reusability and increase maintenance complexity
- **Mixed Responsibilities**: Mixing UI presentation logic with data fetching or business logic responsibilities

### Design System Issues
- **Hard-coded Values**: Using hard-coded colors and fonts instead of semantic design system tokens
- **Inconsistent Styling**: Not following design system guidelines leading to visual inconsistency
- **Custom Solutions**: Implementing custom solutions instead of leveraging SwiftUI's built-in features
- **Non-responsive Design**: Ignoring responsive design principles for different device sizes and orientations

### Accessibility Neglect
- **Missing Accessibility**: Neglecting accessibility features like VoiceOver labels and Dynamic Type support
- **Color Dependency**: Design patterns that rely solely on color for information conveyance
- **Motion Insensitivity**: Not respecting user motion preferences and animation accessibility settings
- **Contrast Issues**: Poor contrast ratios that don't meet accessibility guidelines

### Testing Deficiencies
- **Insufficient Testing**: Not implementing comprehensive testing strategies for views and components
- **Missing Previews**: Not implementing Xcode Previews for development validation and design verification
- **Performance Ignorance**: Not testing view rendering performance and memory usage optimization
- **Accessibility Testing Gaps**: Not validating accessibility features and assistive technology compatibility

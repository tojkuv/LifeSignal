# Storage

Supabase Storage provides secure file storage with bucket organization, signed URL generation, and Row Level Security policies for user-scoped file access through Go backend services.

## Content Structure

### Bucket Layout
- **public/**: Read-only assets accessible to all users
- **user_uploads/<uid>/**: Private user files restricted by UID
- **temp/**: Ephemeral, short-lived files for processing
- **archive/**: Long-term retention for compliance and backups

### File Operations
- **Signed URLs**: Generate signed URLs in Go for upload/download operations with context.Context
- **MIME Validation**: Validate MIME type, file size, and scan uploads for malware with type-safe Go patterns
- **RLS Enforcement**: Enforce RLS on `storage.objects` to restrict access by `uid`
- **Service Role Security**: Never include `service_role` keys in client-side code
- **Type Safety**: Use structured Go types for file metadata and operation responses
- **Structured Logging**: Log all file operations to Loki with structured fields for observability

### Processing Pipeline
- **Background Jobs**: Offload media processing to background jobs or edge functions with gRPC integration
- **Content Scanning**: Validate file content and scan for security threats with structured error handling
- **Size Limits**: Enforce file size limits to prevent abuse with proper Go validation
- **Type Restrictions**: Restrict allowed file extensions and content types with type-safe patterns
- **Context Management**: Use context.Context for all file operations with proper timeout and cancellation
- **Metrics Collection**: Collect file operation metrics with Prometheus for monitoring and alerting

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Upload Errors**: File size limits, invalid formats, network failures, bandwidth constraints, and quota violations
- **Authorization Errors**: Unauthorized access attempts, policy violations, authentication failures, and permission denials
- **Quota Errors**: Bucket size limits, user quota exceeded, storage capacity constraints, and rate limiting
- **Processing Errors**: File transformation failures, validation errors, content scanning issues, and pipeline failures
- **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts, transfer interruptions, CDN delivery failures, and connectivity issues
- **Performance Errors**: Slow upload/download speeds, concurrent operation limits, resource constraints, and bottlenecks

### Recovery Strategies
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive retry delays for transient upload, download, processing failures, and rate limiting
- **Resumable Operations**: Checkpoint-based recovery for interrupted uploads, large file transfers, and network failures
- **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative storage options, degraded functionality during service outages, and backup systems

# Authentication

Firebase Authentication serves as the centralized identity provider for phone-only authentication, delivering secure user authentication and authorization with seamless integration across Supabase Database, Supabase Storage, and Fly.io gRPC Functions to ensure consistent user identity and access control throughout the backend architecture.

## Content Structure

### Authentication Methods
- **Phone Number Authentication**: SMS-based verification with rate limiting and regional support as the primary authentication method
- **Custom Token**: Server-side user creation and administrative authentication for system operations
- **Anonymous Authentication**: Temporary access for guest users with upgrade paths to phone authentication
- **JWT Token Management**: Secure token generation, validation, and refresh handling across all services

### Service Integration
- **Database Integration**: Firebase JWT validation in PostgreSQL functions with Row Level Security policies
- **Storage Integration**: Firebase authentication controls file access permissions with user-scoped organization
- **gRPC Integration**: Centralized JWT validation in gRPC interceptors with context propagation
- **Custom Claims**: Structured role-based access control across all backend services

### Authentication Flow
- **User Authentication**: Client authenticates using phone number verification
- **Token Generation**: Firebase issues signed JWT with user context and custom claims
- **Service Validation**: Backend services verify token signature and expiration
- **Claims Processing**: Services extract and validate user permissions for access control

### Security Architecture
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Enhanced security for administrative and sensitive operations
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Hierarchical permission system using custom claims
- **Session Management**: Secure token refresh handling with automatic session restoration
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks and excessive authentication attempts

## Error Handling

### Error Categories
- **Validation Errors**: Invalid input format, missing fields, or malformed requests
- **Authentication Errors**: Invalid credentials, expired tokens, or account issues
- **Authorization Errors**: Insufficient permissions or access control violations
- **Network Errors**: Connection timeouts, service unavailability, or API limits
- **Rate Limiting**: Excessive authentication attempts or quota exceeded
- **SMS Delivery Errors**: SMS provider failures, invalid phone numbers, or regional restrictions

### Recovery Strategies
- **Graceful Degradation**: Limited functionality for unauthenticated users with clear upgrade paths
- **Exponential Backoff**: Progressive retry delays for transient failures with circuit breaker patterns
- **User-Friendly Messages**: Clear error communication with actionable guidance and support options
- **Fallback Methods**: Alternative authentication options when primary SMS delivery fails
- **Session Recovery**: Automatic token refresh and seamless session restoration
- **Circuit Breakers**: Service protection during authentication service outages

## Anti-patterns

### Security Anti-patterns
- **Client-Side Only Validation**: Relying exclusively on client-side authentication without server-side validation
- **Insecure Token Storage**: Storing authentication tokens in insecure locations without proper encryption
- **Weak Security Policies**: Using weak password policies or not implementing proper security requirements
- **Missing Rate Limiting**: Not implementing rate limiting, leading to potential brute force vulnerabilities

### Architecture Anti-patterns
- **Mixed Concerns**: Mixing authentication concerns with business logic in the same components
- **Hardcoded Logic**: Hardcoding user roles, permissions, or authentication logic in client applications
- **Admin Privilege Misuse**: Exposing Firebase Admin SDK credentials or using admin privileges in client code
- **Custom Claims Misuse**: Storing sensitive or large amounts of data in Firebase Authentication custom claims

### Implementation Anti-patterns
- **Inadequate Error Handling**: Ignoring authentication errors or providing inadequate error handling and recovery
- **Missing Verification**: Skipping phone verification for new accounts or not enforcing account verification
- **Token Scope Violations**: Using authentication tokens beyond their intended scope or lifetime
- **Insufficient Testing**: Implementing custom authentication without comprehensive security review and testing

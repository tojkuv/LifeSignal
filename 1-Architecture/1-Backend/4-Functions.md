# Functions

Go gRPC Functions on Fly.io provide scalable microservices with authentication middleware, database connections, and comprehensive error handling for backend API operations.

## Content Structure

### Service Architecture
- **Services**: `auth`, `user`, `data`, `file`, `notifications` with type-safe gRPC definitions
- **gRPC Middleware**: JWT verification, Context propagation of `uid`, roles with context.Context
- **Database Connections**: Use `pgxpool` for DB connections with SQLC-generated type-safe queries
- **Multi-Region**: Deploy multi-region with Fly volumes or Postgres read replicas
- **Type Safety**: Use Protocol Buffers for service contracts and Go code generation
- **Context Propagation**: Pass context.Context through all service layers for cancellation and tracing

### Resilience Patterns
- **Timeouts**: Apply timeouts on all operations using context.Context with proper cancellation
- **Retries**: Implement retries with jitter for transient failures using Go patterns
- **Circuit Breakers**: Use circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures with Go implementations

## Error Handling

### Error Categories

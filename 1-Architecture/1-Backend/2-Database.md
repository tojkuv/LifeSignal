# Database

Supabase Database delivers PostgreSQL-powered data storage with real-time capabilities and Firebase Authentication integration, serving as the central data layer accessed only through Fly.io APIs. It provides comprehensive Row Level Security policies, live subscriptions, and type-safe operations that seamlessly connect Firebase Authentication, Supabase Storage, and Fly.io gRPC services.

## Content Structure

### Schema Organization

## Anti-patterns

### Security Anti-patterns
- **Bypassing RLS**: Using service_role key on client-side or bypassing Row Level Security policies without proper justification
- **Weak Authentication**: Not properly validating Firebase JWT tokens or implementing insufficient authentication checks
- **SQL Injection Risks**: Hardcoding SQL queries without parameterization, creating security vulnerabilities
- **Insufficient Access Control**: Not implementing comprehensive RLS policies for all sensitive data access

### Performance Anti-patterns
- **Inefficient Queries**: Using SELECT * queries instead of specific column selection for performance optimization
- **Poor Indexing**: Creating excessive or redundant indexes that impact write performance and storage costs
- **Missing Pagination**: Not implementing proper pagination for large result sets, causing performance issues
- **Connection Mismanagement**: Not implementing proper database connection lifecycle management and resource cleanup

### Architecture Anti-patterns
- **Large Binary Storage**: Storing large binary data directly in database tables instead of using Supabase Storage
- **Manual Schema Changes**: Making manual schema changes without creating corresponding migration files
- **Complex RLS Logic**: Implementing complex business logic in RLS policies instead of application layer
- **Missing Constraints**: Not using foreign key constraints, leading to referential integrity issues

### Testing and Monitoring Anti-patterns
- **Insufficient Testing**: Not testing Row Level Security policies comprehensively with different user contexts
- **Poor Error Handling**: Not handling database connection errors, timeouts, and transaction failures properly
- **Missing Monitoring**: Ignoring database performance monitoring and query optimization opportunities
- **Inadequate Backup**: Not implementing proper backup and disaster recovery strategies with testing

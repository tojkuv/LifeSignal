# Augment Guidelines

## RESPONSE
1. **No Hallucination:** If unknown, say "I don't know"
2. **Specific:** No vague answers to specific queries
3. **"Why" on Mistakes:** Analyze actual code/actions, identify errors, give examples
4. **Code First:** Check code before making claims
5. **Uncertainty:** State it, verify with tools, explain verification
6. **No Assumptions:** About project, configs
7. **Analyze Mistakes:** Provide specific feedback on errors

## CODEBASE
1. **Pre-Change:** Use codebase-retrieval before changes
2. **Context:** Understand dependencies before modifying
3. **For Each Change:** Retrieve files, check imports/patterns
4. **File Edits:** View entire file, ID affected elements
5. **Verify Imports:** Ensure correctness before submitting
6. **New Functions:** Check for existing similar ones first
7. **No Blind Copy:** Understand any copied code

## SERVERS
1. **No New Servers:** Never use "npm run dev" without killing running servers first
2. **Check Processes:** Use `list-processes` before restarts
3. **Restart Existing:** Use exact terminal ID
4. **Restart Steps:** list-processes→kill-process→npm run dev
5. **No New Ports:** Use existing ports only
